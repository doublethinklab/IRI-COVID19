							<p class="txt">I’m Emily Liao, and I’m a graduate of Fu Jen Catholic University’s Department of Public Health. At the time, I got to know many medical students and doctors, and through them I came in contact with the subject of application of medical labor laws and working hours. After graduation, I went to work for the union. The Taipei Doctors Union was founded in July, 2019. Currently, 75% of our union members are from large medical institutions, and the other 25% are from clinics.</p>
							<p class="txt">At present, the union focuses on three things:</p>
							<ul class="decimal">
								<li>To tackle the overworking of doctors and to appeal for a rationalization of their working hours. Most doctors in Taiwan are specialist attending doctors (42,000 out of 50,000 doctors) and are not regulated by the Labor Standards Act; as for resident doctors, working hours must not exceed 320 hours over a four-week period. </li>
								<li>Improving the design of the health insurance system: self-financed medical items.</li>
								<li>Dealing with medical disputes such as on-site violence, and so forth.</li>
							</ul>

							<p class="txt"><b>What kinds of fake news have you been hearing during the pandemic?</b></p>
						</div>
						<div class="block">
							<div class="pic" style="background-image: url(images/head_liao.png);"></div>
							<p class="txt">It can be divided into three categories: The number of confirmed cases, methods of prevention or cure, and China-related. </p>
							<p class="txt">On the number of confirmed cases, LINE social media groups or anonymous Facebook accounts spread numbers of “confirmed cases” in particular locations, causing panic among the public and even sometimes medical personnel. For example, it was rumored that a cluster outbreak had occurred at a medical center in Taoyuan. At the time, a reporter contacted the union to verify the story, and we were able to confirm through our Taoyuan members on the ground that the story was false. </p>
							<p class="txt">Regarding the methods of prevention or cure, we’ve come across some extreme cases of misinformation, such as that cyanide is very poisonous so therefore it can kill the virus. With respect to masks, falsehoods such as "toilet paper is made of the same material as masks" and "some countries distribute masks for free but the Tsai administration is making money off it” have circulated. Because the knowledge threshold of drugs and poisons is low, non-specialist doctors need to spend time to learn how to make a determination, but as long as they ask the right medical staff working at the hospital, they are able to get the correct answers to help them carry out their duties. After all, the entire medical team hopes that the pandemic will end soon.</p>
							<p class="txt">With China-related issues, examples include people saying “they are helping smuggle immigrants in from China,” passing off fake official documents to claim the virus is a man-made bioweapon, and so on. </p>

							<p class="txt"><b>When medical personnel get false medical information, do they take the initiative to clarify or respond to it?</b></p>
						</div>
						<div class="block">
							<div class="pic" style="background-image: url(images/head_liao.png);"></div>
							<p class="txt">If it involves medical information, they will clarify it. For instance, if a doctor puts their name to a clarification matching a specific instance, it will be widely disseminated. However, whether the clarification reaches the original source of the rumor we have no way of knowing. It is fundamental that when a medical team comes across misinformation they will correct it with the facts and put great effort into quashing rumors. The Central Epidemic Command Center (CECC) also found a fair number of doctors to record infomercials with, and many doctors were very willing to cooperate. They felt very pleased to be on TV.</p>

							<p class="txt"><b>As far as you know, why do people believe misinformation and what is reflected behind it?</b></p>
						</div>
						<div class="block">
							<div class="pic" style="background-image: url(images/head_liao.png);"></div>
							<p class="txt">It’s easy for people to panic. Our previous SARS experience was really tough. A hospital had to be quarantined due to failure in handling disease prevention measures properly, which led to the deaths of many medical professionals in the line of duty. There is a basic level of knowledge for prevention of the spread of infectious diseases, with basic examples being wearing a face mask or washing your hands. However, with high-level medical expertise, such as knowing how to treat Covid-19 and what actions to take, the public either doesn’t understand or will get information from unknown sources without making the effort to verify it and will just believe it.</p>
